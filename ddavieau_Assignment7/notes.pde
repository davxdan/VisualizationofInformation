//The settings() function is not needed in most sketches.
//It's only useful when it's absolutely necessary to define the parameters to size() with a variable.
//The settings() method runs before the sketch has been set up, so other Processing functions cannot be used at that point.
//For instance, do not use loadImage() inside settings(). 
//The settings() method runs "passively" to set a few variables, compared to the setup() command that call commands in the Processing API.
